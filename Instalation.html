                              I recommend VS Code where in extensions install the Unity Code Completion extension for MUCH EASIER coding because Unity has 1000+ of its functions.
                              I also recommend that you install the icon packet manager in Unity (it's not called that) but in short it changes the folder icons by name, e.g. if it's a 
                              Scripts folder, it will have a C# icon with a purple background to make it easier to find your way in Unity explorer (btw this is only in Unity explorer so
                              this does not apply to Windows Explorer).
