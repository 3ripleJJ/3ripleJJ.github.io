                              So, in order to be able to work in Unity at all, you must know what is on the screen, so I will explain the functions by number:
                              1. Hierarchy - here you can see all the objects, UI elements, sounds and the like that you have created
                              2. Scenes – this is the basic part where you see everything that is currently visible in the game without starting it (you've seen this before)
                              3. Inspector – when you click on an object in the hierarchy, the inspector shows everything about that object (position, components, scripts added for that object, etc.)
                              4. Explorer – the name says it all, here you can see all the folders, scripts, prefabs and everything you added to the project
                              5. Game tab – when you start the game, this tab opens automatically and you play the game in it
                              6. Asset store - this is the part that has now been transferred to Google, but already permanent graphics, scripts, sounds, scenes and even whole games are added to it.
                              7. Console – this is where you can see all compilation errors, debugs, etc.
