                              Like C++, C# has a base code, but when you create a Script in Unity, it is automatically included, so it is not so important that you know it.
                              In addition, the syntax is very similar to C++ and even practically the same. It has the best things of C++ like speed, a bunch of functions along
                              with some Python-washed functions like Math.Name_Function, so C# is a great programming language not only for Unity but also for basic programming.
                              Variables, creating functions, for/while-loops and most things are the same, so you don't need to learn the syntax from the beginning. When you create
                              variables, you can put public or private in front of them. Public means that it will be seen when you put that script on the gameobject and you use it
                              most often for variables that you want to fine-tune like movement speed or jump force, while private hides the variable and you can only change it through
                              the script.
