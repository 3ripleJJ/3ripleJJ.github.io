                              The game consists of characters, obstacles, maps, enemies, but all this is in Unity Gameobject with added scripts, behaviors... To create a Gameobject in the 
                              Hierarchy, right click, create, Gameobject and select shape. I recommend the cube because it is the most basic graphic and it is not difficult to understand 
                              colliders, etc. When you create it in the Inspector, you will see two Components. Transform and Sprite renderer. Transform is part of Gameobject which contains 
                              position, scale(size), rotation and I think that's it. Mainly here you change the position and it is used for movement. And of course you have a Sprite Renderer 
                              that works as the name suggests.
